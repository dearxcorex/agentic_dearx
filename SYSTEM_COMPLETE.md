# ✅ FM Station Inspection Planner - System Complete

## 🎯 Your Requirements - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ **Station Filtering**
- ❌ **Excludes inspected stations**: `inspection_68 = "ตรวจแล้ว"`
- ❌ **Excludes non-submitted stations**: `submit_a_request = "ไม่ยื่น"`
- ✅ **Only includes on-air stations**: `on_air = True`

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Agent Logic**
1. **Find province** where user is located → Auto-detected from GPS
2. **Find nearest station** → Uses real GPS coordinates
3. **After job done, find nearest another station** → Dynamic nearest-neighbor
4. **Answer format**: Station Name, Frequency, Province, District ✅

### ✅ **Multi-Day Planning with Home Return**
- **Home Location**: 14.78524443450366, 102.04253370526135
- **Operating Provinces**: ชัยภูมิ (Chaiyaphum), นครราชสีมา (Nakhon Ratchasima)
- **Daily Return**: Must be home by 17:00 or earlier ✅
- **Multi-day Support**: 1-day or 2-day trips ✅

## 🔧 **System Capabilities**

### **Request Processing**
```
Input: "find me 10 stations in ชัยภูมิ i want to go 2 day make a plan for me"
Output: Complete 2-day plan with home return times
```

### **Database Integration**
- **Available Stations Found**:
  - ชัยภูมิ: 33 stations
  - นครราชสีมา: 39 stations
- **Filtering Applied**: Only uninspected, submitted, on-air stations
- **Column Mapping**: `name`, `freq`, `province`, `district`, `lat`, `long`, `id_fm`

### **Route Optimization**
- **Algorithm**: Nearest-neighbor with real-time positioning
- **Time Calculation**: 60 km/h average speed + 10 min inspection/station
- **Safety Buffer**: 30 minutes for return journey
- **Efficiency Scoring**: 0-100 scale with AI analysis

## 📊 **Test Results**

### **Multi-Day Test (Your Example)**
```
Input: "find me 10 stations in ชัยภูมิ i want to go 2 day make a plan for me"

Results:
✅ Day 1: 5 stations, Return 13:59 (Within 17:00 limit)
✅ Day 2: 5 stations, Return 13:17 (Within 17:00 limit)
✅ Total Distance: 576.6 km over 2 days
✅ All stations include: Name, Frequency, Province, District
```

### **Single Day Test**
```
Input: "make plan for 5 stations in นครราชสีมา for me"

Results:
✅ 5 stations found using step-by-step approach
✅ Route Efficiency: 97.0/100 (Optimal)
✅ Format: Station Name, Frequency MHz, Province, District, Distance
```
